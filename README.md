# Project

This repository contains Python services and tests for generating PDF reports.

## Fonts

PDF generation requires TrueType fonts that support Cyrillic characters. Place
the necessary `.ttf` files inside a `fonts/` directory or set the
`FONT_PATH` environment variable to point to the regular font file. The
repository does not include the fonts themselves.
